The original idea was to find the page ids for Georgia Colleges on RateMyProfessor using university_testing.py and use them to access every professor's profile at the university from which data would be scraped, then generate OpenAI embeddings which would be stored in a Pinecone index to perform RAG for an AI chatbot, but finding the university ids takes too long, and was abandoned for a free dataset downloaded from Kaggle instead of scraping.
